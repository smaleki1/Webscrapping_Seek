# Webscrapping to predict the factors impact salary

The goal of this project is determine the industry factors that are most important in predicting the salary amounts scrapped from Seek.com.

To limit the scope to job posting only the following jobs are considered. 

data scientist, data analyst, research scientist and business intelligence

This code scrapped the data from the above jobs on Seek.com for two salary ranges (all 80K) and above 100K.

Note:

1- The code called "1_scrape_seek_sm.ipynb" was used to scrap the data

2- The code called "2_preprocessing_sm.ipynb" was used to clean and preprocess the data

3- The code called "3_modelling_sm.ipynb" was used to predict the factors impact the salary amount.

To see the code, you can simply use nbviewer online (https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/) which does not require installation. Simply open nbviewer and paste the notebook link. This is an independent tool that may work when github doesnot.
